        //It defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".
        //It is not a statement. It is a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

        //With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

        //DECLARING STRICT MODE
        //Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
