       //JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
       //In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

       //The let and const Keywords
       //Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
       //Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

       //Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
       carName = "Volvo";
       let carName;
       //will cause reference error

       //Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply not run.
       carName = "Honda";
       const carName;
       //will cause syntaxt error
