        JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:
        -> Global scope
        -> Function Scope
        -> Block Scope

        GLOBAL SCOPE
        --------------
        Variables declared Globally (outside any block or function) have Global Scope.
        Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

        FUNCTIONAL SCOPE
        ----------------
        Each JavaScript function have their own scope.
        Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
        declared inside a function.

        BLOCK SCOPE
        -----------
        Before ES6, JavaScript variables could only have Global Scope or Function Scope.
        ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
