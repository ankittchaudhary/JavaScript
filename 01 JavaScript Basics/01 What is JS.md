/**
 * JavaScript Programming Language Documentation
 * 
 * JavaScript is a versatile, lightweight, and interpreted programming language
 * primarily designed for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic
 * content on web pages and has evolved to support full-stack development.
 * 
 * ## Core Features
 * - **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold any data type and change types at runtime
 * - **First-Class Functions**: Functions are objects and can be passed as arguments
 * - **Prototype-Based Inheritance**: Objects inherit directly from other objects
 * - **Event-Driven**: Supports asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await
 * - **DOM Manipulation**: Can interact with and modify HTML documents in real-time
 * - **Object-Oriented**: Supports objects, classes (ES6+), and encapsulation
 * - **Functional Programming**: Supports higher-order functions, closures, and immutability patterns
 * 
 * ## Primary Uses
 * - **Frontend Development**: Browser-based UI interactions and DOM manipulation
 * - **Backend Development**: Server-side applications using Node.js runtime
 * - **Full-Stack Development**: Building complete web applications
 * - **Mobile Development**: Cross-platform apps via React Native, NativeScript
 * - **Desktop Applications**: Electron-based desktop software
 * - **Real-Time Applications**: WebSocket support for live data streaming
 * 
 * ## Key Characteristics
 * - Runs in browsers without compilation
 * - Asynchronous and event-driven architecture
 * - Single-threaded with event loop mechanism
 * - Supports ES6+ modern features (arrow functions, destructuring, modules)
 * - Rich ecosystem with npm package manager
 * 
 * ## Common Frameworks & Libraries
 * - React, Vue, Angular (Frontend)
 * - Node.js (Backend runtime)
 * - Express.js (Web framework)
 * - Webpack (Module bundler)
